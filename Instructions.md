Welcome to the Nmap Script writing workshop. I'm super excited to be
teaching this workshop at DEFCON 31!

A few notes:

1. The workshop is 4 hours long with a break in the middle
2. You should have some rudimentary programming knowledge
3. You MUST bring a laptop and follow the instructions below.
4. Please try and have the VM setup prior to class, the class starts with a Lab
   and only one USB drive will be available to install the VM during the class
