title: Lab 0 - Start your Containers!

Welcome to the DEFCON 31 Nmap workshop! 

Before we get started you need to have a copy of the class VM (or a suitable linux install with the ability to build Nmap from source and edit LUA scripts). 

# Open a terminal (pressing the windows key or the apple command key will bring up a search where you can type 'terminal' or just click on the terminal icon at the bottom of the screen)
# Make sure you're in your home folder: `cd ~`
# Your genius instructor forgot to inlclude some changes to the runme script, so run this first:
## Download a newer copy of the runme script: `wget -O runme_first.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mainframed/DEFCON31/main/runme_first.sh`
# Run the run me script to download the necessary stuff for class: `./runme_first.sh`
