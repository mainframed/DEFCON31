title: Lab 1 - Build Nmap

! Purpose

We only have the Nmap source, its time to build it

! Steps

# Make sure you're in the nmap folder: `cd ~/Labs/nmap`
# Run the configure command: `./configure --with-liblua=included`
# Compile nmap and ncat: `make`

You should now have nmap, you can test it with `./nmap`
