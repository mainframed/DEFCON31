title: Lab 2 - Port Scan Localhost

Let's do some scan against your VM

# Make sure you're in the Labs folder: `cd ~/Labs`
# Scan localhost: `nmap localhost`
# Scan localhost with more options: `nmap localhost -sV -oA defcon31.lab2 -vv -dd --open` 
# You can review any of the output files by opening any of them with a text viewer
# Scan speed: `nmap localhost -T5`
# Turn down service scan: `nmap localhost -sV --version-intensity 1`
